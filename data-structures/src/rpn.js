/**
Write a javascript program that takes in a string that 
contains a Reverse Polish Notation expression and 
returns the result of the expression. Use your stack 
and queue implementation to help you with the algorithm.

Examples:
    Input: 4 5 *
    Result: 20
    Input: 3 5 10 + * 
    Result: 45

Note: the expression will always have space separated 
      inputs like "4 5 *" rather than "45*" or "4 4*"
